                <h2>Principal's Desk</h2>
                <p>Welcome to our school! As the principal, I am committed to providing a safe and nurturing environment for all students.</p>
                <p>"Flowers leave part of their fragrance in the hand that bestows them." The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled. I appreciate the staff and students of all faculties who use various modes of expansion to present their ideas. As long as our ideas are expressed and thoughts kindled, we can be sure of learning as everything begins with an idea. Just as our mother earth gives us more and more, Learning is not a process limited to schools and colleges only, nor does it end with the conclusion of one's school career. It is indeed a lifelong process. The school is oriented to the total formation of a child and to adaptations of various methods suiting the dynamics of changing world in order to achieve common goals and objectives. It is further characterized by sharing vision, responsibility and above all love and faith in goal in order to achieve it. We live today in a world that is very different from the one we grew up, in the one we were educated in. The world today is changing at such an accelerated rate where we as educators need to pause and reflect on this entire system of education. Our school is well equipped to prepare our children to face the challenges that the future holds and work at implementing a well-balanced curriculum to ensure that the children who walk into the portals of VPS will not just leave their school years but truly be prepared to face life's challenges. Even as we impart education to match the advancement in technology and globalization, we march our children ahead with ethos of moral values and principles. We endeavor constantly to instill these qualities in our children. We pride ourselves to help them grow and develop into sensitive and responsible citizens of the future. Aristotle once said that, "Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all". Principal’s Name (Principal).</p>
